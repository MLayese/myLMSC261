# Mice ReadMe File

## Description
Didn't really have too much problem with this (I **think** I'm doing this right at least)

Created a new folder in 'mylmsc261' called 'mice' and created this README.md

Opened PyCharm CE and creat "mice.py"

Here's the code
Mice = int(3/1)
print (f"{int(Mice)} \n     Blind \n                Mice\n")

Saved it

Transported "mice.py" into myLMSC261/mice

Opened terminal and cd Desktop/LMSC261/myLMSC261/mice

input the following "python3 mice.py""

Doubled checked to make sure everything was running and sent it in
