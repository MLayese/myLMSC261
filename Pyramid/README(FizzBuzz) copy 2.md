# Hash ReadMe File

## Description
I actually had a like one or two issues with this

Created a new folder in 'mylmsc261' called 'FizzBuzz' and created this README.md

Opened PyCharm CE and created "FizzBuzz.py"

Saved it

Transported "FizzBuzz.py" into myLMSC261/FizzBuzz

Opened terminal and cd Desktop/LMSC261/myLMSC261/FizzBuzz

input the following "python3 FizzBuzz.py"

Doubled checked to make sure everything was running and sent it in
