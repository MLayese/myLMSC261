# Python ReadMe File

## Description
Didn't really have too much problem with this (I **think** I'm doing this right at least)

Created a new folder in 'mylmsc261' called 'python' and created this README.md

Opened terminal and cd Desktop/LMSC261/myLMSC261/python

input the following say -v Alex "When I learned Morse code / I couldn't get restful sleep / The rain kept talking" -o Alexhello.aiff

Doubled checked to make sure everything was running and sent it in

Here's the image of my terminal
